Lets explore the differences between a deep and a shallow dip. 

Remember that we are dealing with data from a small sample size. Also that these athletes were all used to a deeper dip.

# TL;DR

... will do some analysis before writing this ...



# Ideas to work on
... takes data from all deep dip and all shallow dip

show position graph, to showcase, that we can see the dip depth

relationship between metrics (plot one against the other, compute correlations)

curves comparison (sd of curves? normalised curves, from lowest position to catch)... lots of fun stuff to add

... first of all compare dip depth metric ... to show that indeed, one group of tosses is deep and other is not as deep
... show the bias, that regular dips for flyers were quite deep...

... compare max height metric (need to add it)
... compare max vel metric
... compare average velocity metric ()

... compare curves
.... see what is interesting
