## About me

As a sports enthusiast and former athlete, I navigate the intersections of sports, science, and technology, driven by a curiosity for the intricacies of the human body. 

With a background in judo and cheerleading, I've developed an appreciation for movement and its intricate relationship with the mind. 

Now, I channel that passion into my work, utilizing engineering to delve deeper into understanding human movement and exploring ways to disseminate that knowledge to individuals.
